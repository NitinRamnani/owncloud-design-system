## CSS utility classes

ownCloud Design System has some utility classes builtin. Some of them
have their own page because of their amount of variations.

## Text wrapping behaviour

Use one of the following classes to enforce a certain wrapping behaviour.

| Class             | Description                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| .oc-text-overflow | Sets overflow to `hidden` without resizing its container.                                     |
| .oc-text-nowrap   | Doesn't break to new lines.                                                                   |
| .oc-text-truncate | Doesn't break to new lines. Text will be truncated, showing an ellipsis instead if necessary. |
| .oc-text-break    | Text will break to new lines at word ends if it exceeds one line.                             |
