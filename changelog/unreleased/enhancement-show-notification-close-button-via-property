Enhancement: Show the notification close button via property

The close-button can now be enabled via the property "dismissible". Additionally the notification will
automatically close after a certain amount of time, which also can be defined via property. When a notification is
dismissible, the timeout can be bypassed with the value 0. Also fixed some links in the docs in addition to that.
