# ownCloud Design System

**ownCloud Design System** is based on [Vue Design System](https://vueds.com/) - **Thanks a lot to [@viljamis](https://twitter.com/viljamis)**

Head over to the [generated docs](https://owncloud.github.io/owncloud-design-system/) for more information!

# How to build locally

You basically run

`yarn install`

followed by
`yarn start`

This will fire up a web server at http://localhost:6060.
Any changes to the code base will result it rebuilding the docs and reloading the content in the browser.
