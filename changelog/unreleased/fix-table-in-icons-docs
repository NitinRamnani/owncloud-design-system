Bugfix: Update table component in OcIcon docs

When the old `<oc-table` was deprecated in the *2.1.0* release, 
it silently broke the [button component docs](https://owncloud.design/#/oC%20Components/OcIcon).
This change fixes it by replacing the deprecated table with the the new `<oc-table-simple>` component.
