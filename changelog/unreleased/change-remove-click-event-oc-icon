Change: Remove click event on OcIcon

We have removed the default click handler on the OcIcon component, expecting it to increase performance of the UI.
Adding a custom click-event handling on an instance of the component is of course still possible - albeit then wrapping it in an OcButton is probably the right choice from an accessibility standpoint.
